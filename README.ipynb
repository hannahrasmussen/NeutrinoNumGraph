    "* Download and install DES as a package if you haven't already:\n",
    "1. Navigate to the directory that your SterileDecayGraphs folder is in. Make a folder there called DES, then make a folder within DES that is also named DES.\n",
    "2. Download ``Differential_Equation_Solver_new.py`` from my GitHub page at https://github.com/hannahrasmussen/DES and put it in the folder within the folder.\n",
    "3. In the folder (not the folder within the folder), put a setup.py folder with the following code:\n",

    "4. Now, go to the terminal and checkout your new folder (not the folder within a folder) using the ‘cd’ command. \n",
    "5. Once you’re there, type and enter ‘pip install -e .’ (including the period). That ‘-e’ extension means that updates you make to the code are automatically also installed, which is obviously what we want.\n",
    "6. Now, to see if it worked, restart your jupyter notebook kernel in ``RunDecayGraphs.ipynb`` and try and do ‘from DES import Differential_Equation_Solver_new.py’. If there are no errors, you can delete that line and should be good to run the code as is."

    "* The first window installs ``DecayGraphs.py`` as ``DG``. See below for details on ``DecayGraphs.py``.\n",
    "* The seconds window calls the function ``graph_BR`` and passes the mixing angle $5 \\times 10^{-5}$ to this function. The graph does not change for different mixing angles, a mixing angle is simply needed to run the decay rate functions from the ``graph_BR`` function. That is, mixing angle changes the rate of each decay (proportional to $\\sin^2(\\theta)$), but does not change the relative abundance of each decay.\n",
    "* The third window call the function ``graph_mix_ms_t``, with 250 MeV as the lower bound for sterile neutrino mass, 350 MeV as the upper bound for sterile neutrino mass, $1 \\times 10^{-5}$ as the lower bound for mixing angle, and $1 \\times 10^{-4}$ as the upper bound for mixing angle. Our model should be accurate for a much wider range of mixing angles, and for masses of 150-500 MeV, but we chose this range since we have only tested masses of 300 MeV thus far and models with mixing angles beyond this range for $m_s=300$ MeV are not noteworthy (either decay too early to have an effect or too late that N-effective blows up).\n",
    "* The fourth and final window calls the function ``graph_final_num`` and passes the arguments of $m_s=300$ MeV and $\\theta=5 \\times 10^{-5}$. Changing mixing angle will change the height of the graph, and changing mass will obviously change the graph's width, but it will also affect the shape of the graph by changing the relative heights of the curves of the various decay paths."
